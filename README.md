# EasyGPG

I made this because I find the GPG commands annoying to write, and I wanted to make something cooler than aliases.

## Dependencies

- gpg
- libxcb-shape0
- libxcb-xfixes0

the last two might already be installed

## Todo

- finish
- add tests
- auto scripts
- make package and release
- add man page or smth
